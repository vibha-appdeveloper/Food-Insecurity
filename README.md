## Project summary

### The issue we are hoping to solve

Food Insecurity problem which region, age, which category people in USA and canada are food insecure and try to shift food banks and budget resources to these people, age group and regions where the problem is more.

### How our technology solution can help

With analysis finding out these problems and create Chat Bots and deploy it in Website and in website we can keep charts and anaytics data where NGOs and Government can see where more problems are and working accordingly.

### Our idea

Problem Statement - Predict for Food NGOs to identify areas and scarcity that will have high food insecurity so the resources can be shifted there.

Solution and Roadmap-
Used IBM Cloud Watson Assistant to create chatbots ai generated virtual assistant.
Used Tableau to do analysis of Food Insecurity data of USA, Canada joined to see this data where more Budget short fall is their and demographically where there is more problem. 
By looking graphical presentation, we can know which area, age has more Food Insecurity problem and Food banks can be shifted their or new Food banks can be made. 


## Technology implementation

### IBM AI service(s) used

- [Watson Assistant](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/watson-assistant) - created chat bots in website for easy and fast approach to solution.


### Solution architecture

Diagram and step-by-step description of the flow of our solution:

1. Taken USA Data and Canada data.
2. In Tableau I imported this data and did analysis
3. In Analysis I found that some regions have more food insecurity and also age and ethnic wise, we have food banks and budgets we should shift banks and investments to these regions/age group.
4. I created Watson Assistant chat bot and deploy in website from WordPress Plugin from IBM.
5. This Chat Bot will make life easier by detecting and providing links or pages to see the charts and you can make decision where the problem is and invest their.

### Project development roadmap

The project currently does the following things.

- From Tableau did analysis and made charts / dashboards attach these charts in website for NGOs and Government to see where to open or shift food banks or invest. 
- Watson Assistant AI Chat bot will guide with the the above problem

In the future we plan to...

Get world data proper data access for all counties and solve every country problem of Food Insecurity and asking world leaders or governments for budgets.
